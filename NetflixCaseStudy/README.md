# Netflix Case Study

## Description
Netflix is a leading media and video streaming platform, boasting over 10,000 movies and TV shows. As of mid-2021, the platform has more than 222 million subscribers worldwide. This dataset includes comprehensive details about Netflix's content, such as cast, directors, ratings, release year, and duration, providing valuable insights into viewing trends and content preferences.

## Business Problem
The goal is to analyze the dataset to derive insights that could assist Netflix in making strategic decisions about the types of shows and movies to produce. Additionally, these insights will help Netflix identify opportunities to expand its business in different countries.

## Business Insights
- **Content Volume**: There has been a significant increase in the volume of movies released between 2015 and 2021, with a peak in 2019 when the highest number of movies and TV shows were added.
- **TV Show Trends**: Most TV shows have only one season, while shows with four or more seasons are considered outliers, falling into the top percentile brackets.
- **Movie Duration**: Movies with a duration of less than 50 minutes are in the lower 25th percentile, while those exceeding 170 minutes are in the higher percentile brackets.
- **Release Year Correlation**: There is a strong correlation between the release year and the year a movie or show is added to Netflix from 2015 to 2021.

## Recommendations
1. **Prioritize Popular Casts**: Some shows and movies have longer lead times before being added to the platform. For example, Anupam Kher is a highly preferred cast member. Netflix should consider adding movies or shows featuring such popular actors as soon as they are released to capitalize on their popularity.

2. **Focus on Family Comedy**: David Dhawan is a renowned director in India known for his family comedy movies. Given that comedy is ranked third in popularity, incorporating more family comedy content could enhance viewership, especially in India.

3. **Optimal Release Timing**: The data indicates that July and December are the most popular months for adding new content. While July's preference is unclear, December, being a holiday season, is an ideal time for releasing new content as people are more likely to watch during this period.

4. **Expand LGBTQ Content in India**: The US has a significant number of LGBTQ movies, while India has comparatively fewer. Recent trends show that LGBTQ movies are performing well in India. Increasing the availability of LGBTQ content could boost viewership and engagement in this market.

By implementing these recommendations, Netflix can optimize its content strategy, improve subscriber engagement, and enhance its market presence across different regions.
