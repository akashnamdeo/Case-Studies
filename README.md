# Delhivery Case Study

## Description
Delhivery is the leading and fastest-growing integrated logistics player in India, with a significant revenue footprint in Fiscal 2021. The company's mission is to build a comprehensive operating system for commerce by combining top-notch infrastructure, exceptional logistics operations, and advanced engineering and technology solutions. The data team at Delhivery leverages vast amounts of data to enhance the companyâ€™s operational efficiency, quality, and profitability, aiming to surpass competitors.

## Business Problem
Delhivery is seeking to gain deeper insights from the data generated by its engineering pipelines. The objectives include:
- **Data Processing**: Cleaning, sanitizing, and transforming raw data into useful features.
- **Data Analysis**: Making sense of this data to support the data science team in developing accurate forecasting models.

## Business Insights
- **Route Distribution**:
  - The dataset reveals that 68.79% of orders are categorized under Full Truck Load (FTL) while 31% are classified as Carting route types.
  - The data covers orders from September and October 2018.

- **Carting Orders Analysis**:
  - A small percentage (2-3%) of carting orders are between Bangalore city and Bangalore Airport.
  - Approximately 4.89% of carting orders involve Bangalore Airport as either the source or destination.
  - For carting orders, Karnataka and Maharashtra are key states, with 18% and 19% of orders having either Karnataka or Maharashtra as the source or destination.

- **Time and Distance Observations**:
  - The route from Pappadahandi_Central_DPP_2 (Orissa) to Visakhapatnam_Gajuwaka_IP (Andhra Pradesh) is identified as the most time-consuming with significant distance.
  - An anomalous case is the route from Gonda_KotwaliN_D (Uttar Pradesh) to Tulsipur_Central_DPP_1 (Uttar Pradesh), which is only 70 km apart but took an unusually high 2536 minutes.

- **Top Locations**:
  - Gurugram and Bengaluru are the top locations with the highest number of orders.
  - Maharashtra and Karnataka are prominent as both the trip source and destination, each contributing 13% of the total orders.
  - Gurugram (14%) and Bhiwandi (10%) are leading sources for orders, while Bangalore stands out as the top destination, handling a significant 25% of all orders.

- **State-to-State Orders**:
  - For state-to-state orders, Maharashtra leads with 16% and Karnataka follows with 15%.

- **Time Metrics**:
  - The average actual time for a trip is consistently greater than the OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) time, suggesting inefficiencies.
  - The average actual trip time aligns with the average segment actual time.
  - Segment OSRM time is consistently higher than the OSRM time.
  - The average segment OSRM distance is found to be greater than the OSRM distance.

## Recommendations
1. **Increase Carting Vehicles**: There is a notable volume of orders between Bangalore city and Bangalore Airport. To improve the turnaround time (TAT) for these orders, it is recommended to increase the number of carting vehicles operating on this route.

2. **Enhance Resources in Karnataka and Bangalore**: Given that Karnataka and Bangalore have the highest number of intra-city orders, adding more carting vehicles in these regions will help reduce shipment TAT and improve service efficiency.

3. **Expand Service Stations**: To address the high volume of orders from key hubs, it is advisable to establish additional Delhivery service stations in Gurugram, Bangalore, and Bhiwandi. This expansion will enhance order processing capabilities.

4. **Investigate High Time Routes**: Certain routes, such as Chandigarh to Mehmdpur, Sidmukh to Hisar, Delhi to Gurugram, Gurugram to Nimrana, and Chandigarh to Solan, show discrepancies where the travel time is disproportionately high relative to the distance. A thorough investigation is needed to identify and address the underlying issues causing these delays.

5. **Optimize Short-Distance Trips**: For routes like Delhi to Delhi Airport, Gurugram to Delhi Airport, and Bangalore to Bangalore Airport, where the average time is unusually high for short distances, consider scheduling these trips during off-peak hours to improve efficiency.

6. **Prioritize Fast Delivery Routes**: Focus on routes with high-speed delivery potential such as Dhanbad to Bihar, Ahmedabad to Udaipur, Delhi to Chandigarh, and Gurugram to Jaipur. Implementing a prime delivery option for these routes can enhance overall delivery speed and customer satisfaction.

By following these recommendations, Delhivery can optimize its logistics operations, reduce inefficiencies, and improve overall service quality.
