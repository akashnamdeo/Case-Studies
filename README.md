# Target Case Study

## Description
Target is a renowned global retailer, known for providing exceptional value, innovation, and customer experience. This case study focuses on Target’s operations in Brazil, analyzing a dataset comprising 100,000 orders from 2016 to 2018. The dataset includes various dimensions such as order status, pricing, payment, freight performance, customer location, product attributes, and customer reviews. The goal is to derive insights that can enhance Target's operations in Brazil, including order processing, pricing strategies, payment and shipping efficiency, and customer satisfaction.

## Business Problem
The objective is to analyze the dataset to uncover actionable insights that can help Target improve its operations in Brazil. This includes optimizing inventory management, enhancing delivery efficiency, and tailoring customer engagement strategies based on data-driven findings.

## Business Insights
- **Order Spike**: A significant spike in orders was observed in November 2017. Specifically, on November 24, 2017, there was a notable increase in orders due to the Black Friday Sale.

- **Shopping Times**: Customers tend to place orders most frequently during the morning and afternoon hours.

- **Customer Distribution**: The top three states—São Paulo (SP), Rio de Janeiro (RJ), and Minas Gerais (MG)—constitute about two-thirds of Target's customer base.

- **Freight Value and Delivery Time**: States such as SP and Paraná (PR) have high mean freight values and extended estimated delivery times.

- **Freight and Delivery Correlation**: States with longer average delivery times generally have higher freight values.

- **Delivery Efficiency**: States with shorter delivery times have lower freight values, while those with longer delivery times incur higher freight charges.

- **Long Delivery Times**: In some states, the average delivery time extends to around a month.

- **Estimated vs. Actual Delivery Dates**: For some states, the actual delivery date exceeds the estimated date by more than 15 days.

## Recommendations
1. **Inventory Management During Sales**: To handle the surge in orders during peak sale periods, such as Black Friday, ensure that inventory levels are adequately stocked. Special attention should be given to high-demand products based on customer preferences and historical sales data.

2. **Optimized Customer Engagement**: Since customers place orders predominantly in the morning and afternoon, consider sending special offers and discount notifications during these times to maximize engagement and conversion.

3. **Focus on Key States**: Maintain optimal inventory levels for states with high customer counts, including São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Minas Gerais, to meet demand effectively and avoid stockouts.

4. **Improve Freight Efficiency**: For states with high freight values and long delivery times, explore partnerships with delivery services or establish warehouses closer to these regions to reduce delivery times and costs.

5. **Warehouse Placement**: Set up warehouses near states with high freight values to mitigate costs and improve delivery efficiency. This can significantly reduce freight charges and enhance overall service quality.

6. **Delivery Partner Utilization**: In states with prolonged delivery times, consider using dedicated delivery partners to expedite the process and improve service reliability.

7. **Address Delivery Delays**: For states where actual delivery dates significantly exceed estimated dates, establish local warehouses or collaborate with additional delivery partners to streamline operations and reduce delays.

By implementing these recommendations, Target can enhance its operational efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and strengthen its market presence in Brazil.
